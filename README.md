# Learning Rust

This repo is where I follow along with [@Hunterdii’s 30DaysOfRust](https://github.com/Hunterdii) to learn Rust—nothing fancy, just my daily notes and code.  
I’m learning so I can turn around and teach it.

## Why this exists
1. Keep my progress visible (and embarrassing enough that I finish).  
2. Collect bite-sized examples I can point future students to.  
3. Force myself to write *explanations*, not just copy-paste.

## How I’m using it
- One folder per day (`Day-1`, `Day-2`, …).  
- Each folder has:  
  - `main.rs` – the working code from the lesson.  
  - `notes.md` – what surprised me, what I googled, what I still don’t get.  
- When I hit a wall I open an issue instead of letting confusion rot in private.

## End goal
Finish the 30 days, polish the notes into mini-lessons, and run a free learning session for friends/family and anyone who'd like to learn how to code in. If just one person avoids the traps I stepped in, the repo already paid rent.
