# Day 3

## What the exercise asked
The exercise asked me to do a hands on challenge and some exercises.

## What worked and what didn't
I tried to advance after getting some help with AI and realized that I can't move on without actually learning it deeply since it hinders you in the long run. I took a long hiatus because I was busy with work but I'm back now.

It's always great to start learning rust the hard way!
