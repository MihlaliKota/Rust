# Day 2 

## What the exercise asked
The exercise asked me to create three programs and one of them was just a follow along.

## What worked and what didn't
I had an error I couldn't stop encountering. Until I went to Claude AI. I then saw that my mistake was given a correction within the error popup. I love rust!
